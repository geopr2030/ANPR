# ANPR
Automatic Number Plate Recognition Using EasyOCR and OpenCV

Problem Statement : The need for efficient and accurate number plate recognition is growing in various fields, including traffic management, law enforcement, and parking systems. Traditional methods of number plate recognition often involve manual processes that are time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems can alleviate these issues by providing a fast, accurate, and automated solution for recognizing and processing vehicle number plates.

Solution : This project aims to develop an ANPR system using EasyOCR and OpenCV (cv2) to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images and video streams. EasyOCR is a powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that can accurately read text from images, while OpenCV provides robust image processing capabilities to enhance and detect number plates.

How It Works

Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of vehicle images with visible number plates from various sources to ensure robust training and testing.
Image Preprocessing: Preprocess the images by resizing, converting to grayscale, and applying noise reduction techniques to improve the accuracy of number plate detection and recognition.

Number Plate Detection

Image Enhancement: Use OpenCV functions to enhance the image quality, including contrast adjustment and edge detection.
Number Plate Localization: Apply contour detection and region proposal algorithms to locate and extract the number plate region from the image.
Perspective Transformation: Correct the perspective of the extracted number plate region to align it for better OCR performance.

Number Plate Recognition

Character Segmentation: Use OpenCV to segment individual characters from the number plate for separate recognition.
OCR with EasyOCR: Utilize EasyOCR to recognize and read the characters from the segmented number plate region.
Post-Processing: Implement post-processing steps such as character verification and correction to enhance the recognition accuracy.

Training and Optimization

Training: Train the EasyOCR model on the collected dataset to improve its accuracy for specific number plate formats and styles.
Optimization: Optimize the OpenCV and EasyOCR pipeline to ensure real-time performance and accuracy.

Evaluation

Qualitative Evaluation: Visually inspect the recognized number plates to assess the accuracy and reliability of the system.
Quantitative Evaluation: Use metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the ANPR system.


Application

The developed ANPR system can be applied in various real-world scenarios, including:

Traffic Management: Automated detection and recognition of number plates for monitoring and managing traffic flow.
